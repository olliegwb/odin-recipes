        <h2>Paneer Curry</h2>
        <p>This vegetarian curry uses chunks of creamy paneer in a fragrant butter-style curry sauce. It's mild enough for the whole family to enjoy, but you can spice up this paneer curry with the addition of some fresh chillies if you like it hotter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>

            <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ tbsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 tbsp medium-heat curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>180 ml stock</li>

            <li>175ml double cream</li>
            <li>450 g paneer cheese, chopped into bite sized chunks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method:</h2>

            <li>Add the minced onion, garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onion starts to brown at the edges of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the salt, garam masala, curry powder, paprika and cinnamon. Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the spices start to release their fragrance.</li>
