        <h2>Kale, tomato and lemon zest one-pot spaghetti</h2>
        <p><em>This pasta is a complete revelation.</em> The sauce is made from the pasta water and tomatoes and the pasta cooks all in one pan. No fuss, one pan and a killer bowl of pasta. Pasta and gluten have had a bad write-up. Recently, though, they have come on in leaps and bounds and I opt for interesting pastas as often as I do the traditional kind. Try corn, chickpea or buckwheat spaghetti - they all have incredible individual flavours and make a welcome change if pasta is a staple in your house. The key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a shallow saut√© pan or a casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down, but not too deep.</p>

            <ul class="pasta-ingredients">
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
                <li>400g cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li>the zest of 2 large lemons</li>
                <li>100ml olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                <li>1 x 400g bag of kale or spinach</li>
                <li>parmesan cheese</li>

            <h2>Method:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill and boil a kettle and get all your ingredients and equipment together. You need a large shallow pan with a lid</li>
                <li>Put the pasta into the pan. Quickly and roughly chop the tomatoes in half and throw them into the pan. Grate in the zest of both of the lemons and add the oil and salt. Add 1 litre of boiling water, put a lid on the pan and bring to the boil, then remove the lid and simmer on a high heat for 6 minutes, using a pair of tongs to turn the pasta every 30 seconds or so as it cooks.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, remove any tough stalks from the kale and shred the leaves. Once the pasta has had 6 minutes, add the shredded kale and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and divide between four bowls. If you like, top with a little parmesan.</li>
